# Applying-Image-Processing-Algorithms-on-ESP32-with-static-input-and-dumb-display
Application of a CNN model to the ESP32 with eloquenttinyml library where inputs are provided as a static 8*8 float arrays for every single digit. Also, a dumbdisplay app is used to make real-time predictions with the sequential model proposed in the esp32-mnist file. ( Please see the citation below for esp32-mnist.)
